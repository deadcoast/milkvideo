# sandbag - An integrated solution to Silencing Linters

## INSTRUCTIONS

See attached, then begin drafting and developing a truly useful, mathematically grounded sandbag CLI in my vision. Please note, I am not some developer working hourly at a company. Im trying to find niches in unseen use cases. Im not trying to develop a generic, simple old tool. Im trying to create a tool that went above and beyond what everything else did, intertwining simplicity of the cli front end, with a structured, The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), AST analyzation and Mathematic comparisons control of the back end.

This may seem like a simple task, but the implementation will not be, i will leave you to the advanced design aspects, but i would assume it will need verbose parsing, and i propose incorperating mathematics to enhance this process. Im not looking for corperate, run of the mill boilerplate, im not looking for optimized or streamlined structure. Im looking for a method we can provide this use case in, completely streamlined for users of all types, to ensure proper quality of life. sandbag will need to understand/parse the linters ruleid, understand its configuration format, AND understand how to properly write that ruleid string to a configuration file. For brevitys sake, we will design it for the vscode `markdownlint` plugin and its formats.

## CALL TO ACTION

Ever used edge cases? Not common structures? Different or now plugins or syntax? Linters never understand, and there is a large barrier to editing something so simple as silencing its specific error identification it hand feeds you from its system

### PROBLEM

Sometimes, processes or formats have been around for so long they dont require innovation, automations, tweaking or changing. They just work, as is. Code Linting, and code linting formats as a whole, are not this. The current system works, and it works well. But it is terribly complicated, difficult for people who are not professional developers. Programming and coding is becoming one of the largest hobbies on the planet. Even with AI implementation there is walls of understanding users must need to know. Take python for example, creating .venv, installing project specific packages, installing their versions hoping they have no conflicts, relative and explicit module imports, __init__.py files you chose to use or not. The last thing new developers want to be distracting, complicated, bugged is the linter that is supposed to structure and possibly correct their working code language. Ignoring linter errors is distracting, unfullfilling, and as a whole bad practise. Silencing them inline in the code sometimes works, others it does not. Sometimes it has a specific cancel format, or cancel display of error such as #noqa.

Currently I am using markdown-lint, and it has archiac syntax rules. This is where i got my idea. At first it was an idea to streamline my workflow.

## SOLUTION

I find it redundant to keep turning my linter off and on, or ignoring the glaring yellow underline for warnings on things such as "No Inline HTML". MOST natiev markdown editers will support native markdown rendering now in there text editors. It makes zero sense to have this as a rule. Obsidian (one of the biggest providers for ongoing markdown support) has native, shipped, html support inline markdown files.

I would like to create a simple, easy to use, intuitive way, to provide linting ruleid outputs to a cli application, and add save them to the a `smother` list. The `smother` list works similar to how a .gitignore file would work, except its adding preffered rules to ignore on the linter specified.

When i work with markdown files(markdown lint), there is no real standard or well accepted linting format.  The sandbag application was designed to fill this less than annoying whole. I believe the current system is one of those use cases that experienced devs dismiss as repetitive but essential, and newcomers are having enough time understanding the code they are trying to learn, let alone all the tools that come with them. sandbag is a first line of defence for one of those stressful overheads.

Designed for new devs, sandbag is a simple and effective lightwweight cli tool with an emphasis on aesthetic user experiences. The front end cli output should be structured, beautifully designed, and operate for a user of any experience.

## WORKFLOW

Three easy steps:

1. Search the problems window in your ide, or a linter cli output for a linter `ruleid`.
2. Copy the linters proprietary ruleid code utput, below i will provide an example from the `markdownlint` plugin:
3. Run the `sandbag` cli and provide the linters `ruleid` to the interactive menu.

Thats all, thats it(Assuming you are running the cli from your project directory). When the process is complete, `sandbag` cli will have added the linters `ruleid` as the correct ignored format the linters configuration file.

### `markdownlint` EXAMPLE

Linter Output Format(VSCODE Problems Window):

```bash
MD033/no-inline-html: Inline HTML [Element: summary]markdownlintMD033
```

- In this specific example, the `ruleid` would be `MD033`

## COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE DESIGN PLAN - OPTIMIZED FORMAT TO PROVIDE AI

REVIEW MY DAILY NOTE ENTRY FOR AN IDEA, SO OUT IN THE OPEN AND RIGHT INFRONT OF MY EYES I WAS BLIND TO SEE IT (and i bet most other devs are too).

I need you to translate my writing and daily jourbnaling into a more sophisticated, documentation suite for this application. YOUR DOCUMENTS WILL BE FED TO CursorAI in the CursorIDE. I am a paid user, i have access to claude 4,4.1, gpt5 inside the CursorIDE as agents, this should be the reference to your processing power to optimize documents for token usage and contextual awareness. BOTH ARE IMPORTANT. IF TOO SIMPLE, THE AI JUST MAKES EVERYTHING UP. IF DOCS TOO VERBOSE, OVER COMPLICATED IN EXPLANATION, OR FILLED WITH THE OVER USE OF HEAVY STYLISTIC CHARACTERS SUCH AS "`back tick` ```inline_code```, bold italic, bulletpoints. IT MUST BE A BALANCED DESIGN, THE AI SHOULD REVIEW IT IN COMPLETE, AND UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT SO IT CAN BEGIN ACCURATELY INTEGRATING AND GENERATING SOLUTIONS. DONT JUST GUESS, PUT REAL EFFORT INTO HOW YOU STRUCTURE THIS DESIGN PLAN, AS IT WILL BE HEAVILY REVIEWED AND ANALYZED BY AI TO UNDERSTAND THE CODEBASE AND WHAT WE DESIGN. THESE DESIGN PLANS WILL BE LIVING DOCUMENTS IN THE docs DIRECTORY, CONTINUALLY UPDATED AND REFERENCED AS THE CODE BASE IS DEVELOPED.

I will be providing CLAUDE 4.1 or GPT 5 with this documentation when we are finished. The agent will then review the documents and begin generating my application with me.

The design must provide ALL CONTEXT, ALL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE REASONS WHY, PROBLEMS, SOLUTIONS. IT MUST UNDERSTAND THE DIRECT USE CASE NEW HUMANS HAVE LEARNING CODE AND THE VAST ENTRY LEVEL LEARNING CURVE. With ai continually improving, so is the market for more tools that may seem "redundant". A delivery driver sounds redundant aswell, but here we are in a world where the hospitality industry is propped up by corporations that exclusively deliver food as a service. Times are changing, with new tools and new specialized coding intelligence use cases. The Coding and Programming Entry Level is shrinking, fast. More people than ever have the most streamlined access to generating and learning code with AI, Agents, Vibe Coding IDE.

There must be millions of new users who are battling their way through alien looking code, their entire IDE blinking with red errors, their .venv not sources, their imports wrong, so many things. To fix that? You have to lint it. If the linter doesnt work? If its bugged? If it doesnt like some of your code, even if its correct? IT ERRORS. AND IT DOESNT TELL YOU HOW TO DISMISS IT, IT DOESNT MAKE IT EASY. HOW ARE WE FLIRTING WITH QUANTUM COMPUTERS AND STILL WRESTLING WITH .venv files and seperate linter formatting, unstandardized syntax opinions. We are both the most innovative and also the most trivial species. THIS SIMPLE ISSUE IS SUCH A GLARING ONE IN THE LARGER PICTURE. Statistically speaking, we will get a tsunami of new coding hobbyist and enthusiast over the next 5 years. I am to build some tools for this market.
