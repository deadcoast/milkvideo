# REVISIONS

Your output and work is getting sloppy and unprofessional, there are many many errors now in the code. Your implementations are only half completed, cascading errors across the codebase. e.g; you wrote the correct rich imports, but didnt create the functions to utilize them.

**THIS IS AN ACTIVE CODEBASE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.** 
- IF YOU FIND UN USED VARIABLES: *CHECK FOR DUPLICATE IMPLEMENTATION*
    - IF NO INFORMATION ON DUPLICATE INTEGRATION, CORRUPT NAMING NAMING, SKELETON FOR THE SELECTED VARIABLE: GENERATE THE FULL AND COMPLETE INTEGRATIONS FOR THE UNUSED VARIABLES.

**NOTE:** DELETING CODE IS NOT CORRECTING CODE. DELETING ERRORS IS NOT CORRECTING ERRORS. ALMOST ALL ERRORS CREATED ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INTEGRATED OR IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY.
